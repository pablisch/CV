## Pablo Joyce

I am a Full Stack Developer and gold medal pillow fighting champion excited to find a great opportunity to drive my programming skills forward, expand my knowledge base and bring obvious benefit in a supportive environment. I enjoy all aspects of full stack development but am especially keen to further develop my front end skills.

Before training in software development at the excellent Makers Academy, I was privileged to be working in primary schools in a variety of exciting and exceptional roles such as being a Forest School leader, planting, developing and nurturing a woodland where there had been an open field, developing a tech and maker driven STEM lab and sending a Raspberry Pi computer into near space sending live photos and flight telemetry as it went. While teaching I also worked for the fantastic Raspberry Pi Foundation writing educational resources and prior to all that I was a bespoke furniture designer and craftsperson following one thread of my lifelong love of making and creativity.

I see software development as an extension of my love of making and am excited by the endless possibilities of code, the problem solving and rapid development. As a primary school teacher I spent a few years as a specialist computing teacher where I introduced children to an exciting new world of possibilities such as creating robots using Raspberry Pis, micro:bits and Hummingbirds, and this also opened a door for myself, seeing the world as a digital creator rather than simply a digital user.

## Skills



As a primary STEM lead, I was selected and tasked with researching, initialising and delivering a Forest School provision from scratch which was a large-scale, radical new offering for the school. Despite being far outside my knowledge base and way outside the remit of any primary teacher role, the school was confident that I could deliver this with my already proven record of delivery with the STEM Makers space. I exceeded expectations, by establishing a sizeable new woodland and outdoor learning environment ideal for the needs of our children whilst delivering exceptional Forest School delivery throughout the process under challenging conditions.

I love problem solving which was an essential skill in developing the STEM/makers space and the baby woodland, dealing with limited resources, complex safe-guarding issues and as well as fulfilling the basic needs of over a thousand freshly planted saplings over a baking hot summer when everyone would be on holiday. From a point of zero knowledge, I personally designed and implemented an irrigation system allowing March Wood to thrive and in just two years some birch and cherry trees reached twice my height. Woodland design and management from scratch was an endless supply of challenges to be solved requiring resilience, initiative and ingenuity.

Both teaching and furniture exposed me to working both completely independently and collaborating closely with others in a wide variety of working relationships from managing staff as a school leader designing and implementing purpose-led projects to presenting proposals to senior leadership and governors. As a self-employed furniture craftsman I was solely responsible for every aspect of running my business.

In my last role as a Forest School Leader, I developed a great relationship with the colleagues that I led fostering buy-in from the whole team resulting in a coheseive and consistent delivery of our principles and provision. The result of this collaborative leadership approach was uprecedented work satisfaction amongst the team and a an exceptional experience for our children throughout the varied cohort groups.

For myself, feeling that my work was worthwhile and valued was a key factor in my work satisfaction and I have always sought to make work a similarly positive experience for my colleagues. Strong, clear communication and a collaborative approach to leadership are key to this as well as never assuming that others are aware of the value of their work and the impact that they are having.

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

# From my original CV raw

## Personal and Professional Profile

I have spent the last three years growing a small woodland and developing Forest School at a north London primary school. Prior to that, I developed a maker space and promoted STEM at the same school, whilst also working freelance for the Raspberry Pi Foundation developing educational resources for the Non-Formal Learning Team.
Previously, I worked as a specialist computing teacher in various London primary schools. Often this was teaching coding but also covering all areas of computing, robot building, high altitude balloon launch, additional technical and curriculum support, and setting up a STEAM classroom and promoting an ambitious STEAM curriculum throughout the school.
I am a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator, Skycademy graduate, Google Certified Educator, Apple Teacher and Certified Microsoft Educator and have a passion for physical computing, integrating technology, coding and making.
Before specialising in computing, I trained and worked as a primary class teacher in London for five years, developing and teaching my own year group curriculum. I love working with children and helping them learn through active participation and exploration.
Prior to teaching, I was a designer/maker of furniture, art objects and small constructions. I have studied making at the degree level at university in High Wycombe and continued my learning through practical workshop experience in established workshops before working as a self-employed maker and designer of one-off custom pieces.
I have lived in France and the Basque region of Spain, and speak good French and bad Basque. I have also travelled extensively, especially throughout India.
