## Pablo Joyce

I am a Full Stack Developer and pillow fighting gold medalist eager to find an exciting opportunity to consoldate my programming skills, expand my knowledge and bring obvious benefit in my new role. I enjoy aspects of full stack development but am keen to focus on debeloping my front end skills.

Before training in software development at the excellent Makers Academy, I was privileged to be working in primary schools in a variety of exciting and exceptional roles such as being a Forest School leader and planting a woodland from nothing in a open field, developing a tech and maker driven STEM lab and sending a Raspberry Pi computer into near space sending photos and telemetry as it went soaring towards the International Space Station. Before teaching I was a bespoke furniture designer and craftsperson following one thread of my lifelong love of making and creativity. I see software development as an extension of this love of making.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

## Work Experience

_Your job title_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)

- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team

# From my original CV raw

## Personal and Professional Profile

I have spent the last three years growing a small woodland and developing Forest School at a north London primary school. Prior to that, I developed a maker space and promoted STEM at the same school, whilst also working freelance for the Raspberry Pi Foundation developing educational resources for the Non-Formal Learning Team.
Previously, I worked as a specialist computing teacher in various London primary schools. Often this was teaching coding but also covering all areas of computing, robot building, high altitude balloon launch, additional technical and curriculum support, and setting up a STEAM classroom and promoting an ambitious STEAM curriculum throughout the school.
I am a Raspberry Pi Certified Educator, Skycademy graduate, Google Certified Educator, Apple Teacher and Certified Microsoft Educator and have a passion for physical computing, integrating technology, coding and making.
Before specialising in computing, I trained and worked as a primary class teacher in London for five years, developing and teaching my own year group curriculum. I love working with children and helping them learn through active participation and exploration.
Prior to teaching, I was a designer/maker of furniture, art objects and small constructions. I have studied making at the degree level at university in High Wycombe and continued my learning through practical workshop experience in established workshops before working as a self-employed maker and designer of one-off custom pieces.
I have lived in France and the Basque region of Spain, and speak good French and bad Basque. I have also travelled extensively, especially throughout India.
